# Overview

This repo contains a compilation of examples and explanations for SOLID design principles and GoF software design patterns.
The main goal of this repo is to help anyone who needs a clarification on these subjects. Feel free to fork the repo
and add any examples you consider suitable.

## SOLID design principles

SOLID design principles encourage us to create more maintainable, understandable and flexible software. Which will
lead to time saving in later stages of the software life cycle. Such is the importance of SOLID design principles,
that they are a MUST TO KNOW in the software engineering career path. 

Each letter of the SOLID acronym stands for a different principle. In this repo you will find an explanation
for each pattern and a problem which it is aiming to solve, furthermore, it includes an example in Java and C#. 

1. [Single responsibility principle](SOLID%20principles/1-Single-responsibility-principle)
2. [Open-closed principle](SOLID%20principles/2-Open-closed-principle)
3. [Liskov substitution principle](SOLID%20principles/3-Liskov-substitution-principle)
4. [Interface segregation principle](SOLID%20principles/4-Interface-segregations-principle)
5. [Dependency inversion principle](SOLID%20principles/5-Dependency-inversion-principle)

## Software design patterns

Design patterns are typical solutions to common problems in the software industry. Think of them as blueprint that you 
can leverage when you face one of these issues. This section includes links leading to explanations and examples
of each pattern. There are three types of software design patterns:

### Creational patterns

Creational patterns deal with the process of creation of objects by increasing flexibility and reuse
of existing code.

* [Abstract Factory](Gang%20of%20four%20Design%20patterns/Creational%20patterns/Abstract%20Factory)
* [Builder](Gang%20of%20four%20Design%20patterns/Creational%20patterns/Builder)
* [Factory Method](Gang%20of%20four%20Design%20patterns/Creational%20patterns/Factory%20Method)
* [Object Pool](Gang%20of%20four%20Design%20patterns/Creational%20patterns/Object%20Pool)
* [Prototype](Gang%20of%20four%20Design%20patterns/Creational%20patterns/Prototype)
* [Simple Factory](Gang%20of%20four%20Design%20patterns/Creational%20patterns/Simple%20Factory)
* [Singleton](Gang%20of%20four%20Design%20patterns/Creational%20patterns/Singleton)

### Structural patterns

Structural patterns deal with the way classes and objects are arranged and composed into larger structures, 
while keeping them flexible and efficient.

* [Adapter](Gang%20of%20four%20Design%20patterns/Structural%20patterns/Adapter)
* [Bridge](Gang%20of%20four%20Design%20patterns/Structural%20patterns/Bridge)
* [Composite](Gang%20of%20four%20Design%20patterns/Structural%20patterns/Composite)
* [Decorator](Gang%20of%20four%20Design%20patterns/Structural%20patterns/Decorator)
* [Fa√ßade](Gang%20of%20four%20Design%20patterns/Structural%20patterns/Facade)
* [Flyweight](Gang%20of%20four%20Design%20patterns/Structural%20patterns/Flyweight)
* [Proxy](Gang%20of%20four%20Design%20patterns/Structural%20patterns/Proxy)


### Behavioral patterns

Behavioral patterns describe how classes and objects interact and communicate with each other.

* [Chain Of Responsibility](Gang%20of%20four%20Design%20patterns/Behavioral%20patterns/ChainOfResponsibility)
* [Command](Gang%20of%20four%20Design%20patterns/Behavioral%20patterns/Command)
* [Interpreter](Gang%20of%20four%20Design%20patterns/Behavioral%20patterns/Interpreter)
* [Iterator](Gang%20of%20four%20Design%20patterns/Behavioral%20patterns/Iterator)
* [Mediator](Gang%20of%20four%20Design%20patterns/Behavioral%20patterns/Mediator)
* [Memento](Gang%20of%20four%20Design%20patterns/Behavioral%20patterns/Memento)
* [Null Object](Gang%20of%20four%20Design%20patterns/Behavioral%20patterns/NullObject)
* [Observer](Gang%20of%20four%20Design%20patterns/Behavioral%20patterns/Observer)
* [State](Gang%20of%20four%20Design%20patterns/Behavioral%20patterns/State)
* [Strategy](Gang%20of%20four%20Design%20patterns/Behavioral%20patterns/Strategy)
* [Template](Gang%20of%20four%20Design%20patterns/Behavioral%20patterns/Template)
* [Visitor](Gang%20of%20four%20Design%20patterns/Behavioral%20patterns/Visitor)


If you would like to take a deep dive into each of these concepts, I strongly recommend
this [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/design-patterns-in-java-concepts-hands-on-projects/), 
as well as [Refactoring guru](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns) and [Source making](https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns).
