# Facade

We use a facade when we want to interact with a larger number of interfaces. It provides a simplified interface to a library
or framework.

## Problem

In the code we have a broad set of objects related to emails. Ordinarily, youâ€™d need to initialize all of those
objects, keep track of dependencies, execute methods in the correct order, and so on. This poses a great issue as 
it makes harder to use our library.

## Solution

We implement an EmailFacade that provides a simple interface to a complex subsystem which contains lots of moving parts. 
A facade might provide limited functionality in comparison to working with the subsystem directly. However, the 
client only needs to send an order email and this facade gets the job done.
